# Sentiment_Analysis_EDA_Augmentation
Sentiment analysis using EDA augmentation and DistilBERT on Yelp reviews.

Dataset - https://course.fast.ai/datasets ("Yelp reviews - Full")


The Folder has 2 python notebooks
1) DistillBert_SentimentAnalysis
2) EDA_Data_Augmentation

The folder has a file train.xlsx too

Due to computational issues, I could not train the entire dataset, so I downsized the data set and used the train.xlsx data to execute Distill Bert.

The EDA_Data_Augmentation file has the code for EDA augmentation but due to system issues I was not able to implent it entirely for for Sentiment Analysis.

The folder Sentiment has the trained model's saved files.

The train.xlsx is used for the execution for both the files.
